The AI-enabled car parking system utilizing OpenCV combines the power of computer vision and artificial intelligence to automate and optimize the process of parking cars. By leveraging OpenCV's image processing and object detection capabilities, this project aims to provide an intelligent solution for efficient parking space management. Traditionally, parking lots often face challenges such as limited parking spaces, congestion, and inefficient vehicle allocation. This project addresses these issues by automating the parking process, allowing for better space utilization and reduced human intervention. The core technology employed in this project is OpenCV, an open-source computer vision library that provides a rich set of functions and algorithms for image and video analysis. OpenCV allows us to process real-time video streams from parking lot cameras and perform object detection to identify cars. In conclusion, the AI-enabled car parking system using OpenCV aims to revolutionize the traditional parking experience by leveraging computer vision and AI technologies. By automating parking space management, it improves efficiency, optimizes resource utilization, and enhances the overall parking experience for both drivers and parking lot operators.
